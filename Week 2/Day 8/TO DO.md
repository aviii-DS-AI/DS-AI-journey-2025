# ✅ Day 8: First ML Model – Titanic Classification

---

## 🧠 Concepts to Learn
- [ ] What is Supervised Learning?
  - [ ] Difference between Regression & Classification
- [ ] Introduction to `Scikit-learn` (sklearn)
- [ ] Understanding:
  - Features (X) vs Labels (y)
  - Train/Test Split
  - Accuracy Score

---

## 🔨 Hands-on Project
- [ ] Load the Titanic dataset
- [ ] Preprocess:
  - [ ] Handle missing values
  - [ ] Convert categorical columns (like Sex, Embarked)
  - [ ] Drop irrelevant columns (like Name, Ticket)
- [ ] Use `train_test_split()` to split data
- [ ] Build a **Logistic Regression** model with `sklearn`
- [ ] Predict survival on test data
- [ ] Evaluate using:
  - [ ] `accuracy_score`
  - [ ] `confusion_matrix`
  - [ ] `classification_report`

## 🔍 Try This (Challenge Zone)
- [ ] Try a **Decision Tree** model as well
- [ ] Compare which model did better
- [ ] Plot the tree using `plot_tree()` if time allows

## 📝 Journal Prompts
- What surprised you about building a model?
- What part of preprocessing felt confusing or fun?
- What accuracy did your model reach? (Be honest, it’s okay if it’s not high!)

## 🌱 Bonus Goals
- [ ] Try plotting feature importance (if using DecisionTree)
- [ ] Write a markdown summary of what each model did
- [ ] Push this notebook to GitHub as your **First ML Project!**
