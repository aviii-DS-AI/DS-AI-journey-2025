- What did PCA help you *see* that wasn’t visible before?
We had 4D data (Iris) — not something we can visualize directly.
We saw that just 2 components reveal clear clusters.
 PCA gave eyes to a 4D problem — it showed natural patterns and separations.

- How would you explain PCA to a friend using images?
 cloud of 3D points → project it onto different 2D planes → PCA finds the best plane that maximizes spread (variance).


- How do you feel about throwing away data dimensions?
little scary at first! 
We're not throwing away randomly, we’re prioritizing what matters.
It’s like cleaning a messy room: removing clutter actually makes the important stuff stand out.

So it’s less about “losing data” and more about distilling meaning.

Difficulty - Bit Complex I'd say, not grasped properly( Will include in Week 3 Revision Session )
