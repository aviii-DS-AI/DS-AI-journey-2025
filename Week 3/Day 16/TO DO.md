# ✅ Day 16 – K-Means: Let the Patterns Emerge

---

## 📘 Concepts to Learn
- [ ] What is **Clustering**? How is it different from Classification?
- [ ] What is **K-Means Algorithm**?
  - [ ] Role of Centroids
  - [ ] How clusters form
  - [ ] Random Initialization & Re-assignment
- [ ] Key terms:
  - [ ] Inertia / WCSS
  - [ ] Elbow Method
  - [ ] Limitations of K-Means

---

## ⚙️ Hands-On Practice
- [ ] Load a numerical dataset (suggest: `make_blobs()` or `Iris dataset`)
- [ ] Preprocess: Scale using `StandardScaler`
- [ ] Fit a `KMeans(n_clusters=3)` model
- [ ] Visualize clusters with:
  - [ ] Color-coded scatterplot
  - [ ] Centroids shown on plot

---

## 📊 Cluster Evaluation
- [ ] Use `.inertia_` to measure WCSS
- [ ] Try `Elbow Method` to find optimal K
- [ ] Optional: Try `Silhouette Score` using `metrics.silhouette_score()`

## 📓 Reflection Prompts
- What was your “aha” moment with clustering?
- How does it feel to work without labels?
- What’s something K-Means does well, and where might it fail?

---

## 🌱 Bonus Goals (Optional)
- [ ] Try K-Means on Titanic dataset without labels (unsupervised grouping)
- [ ] Compare KMeans vs actual survival labels (just for analysis)
- [ ] Try `DBSCAN` or `Agglomerative Clustering` if curious
