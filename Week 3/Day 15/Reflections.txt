- What part of Naive Bayes clicked with you?
the part that clicked was the simplicity and effectiveness of Naive Bayes, especially in text classification.
Its also veri intuitive as it just makes a matrix of mords as independent features features ans predict.


- Does the “independence assumption” always work?
No, the independence assumption doesn’t always hold in reality, but it works surprisingly well in many cases. 
Words like “free” and “money” in a spam message are related, but the model treats them as if they’re unrelated.


- Would you trust Naive Bayes in real-world text problems?
Yes, I would trust Naive Bayes for many real-world text classification tasks, especially when
The problem is well-suited for independent features, like spam detection, sentiment analysis, or topic classification

However, for more complex text problems where there are strong relationships between features, I’d consider using more advanced models that we'll learn in future.
