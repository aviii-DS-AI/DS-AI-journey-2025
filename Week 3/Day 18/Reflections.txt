- What did tuning improve the most?
Tuning reduced overfitting and helped models generalize better across unseen data.

- How much better was GridSearch compared to default?
very much 
 The confusion matrix and classification report showed fewer misclassifications, better precision & recall across all classes, not just majority ones.

- Where did GridSearch take *too long*?
GridSearch gets slow when:
You have a large dataset
You try many hyperparameters
Or you use expensive models 

- How would you explain GridSearchCV to your younger sibling?
Imagine you're baking cookies and trying different recipes:
Some use more sugar,
Some bake longer,
Some have extra chocolate chips
You try all the combos and ask 5 friends to taste each one (that's cross-validation!).
Then you pick the recipe that made everyone happiest
