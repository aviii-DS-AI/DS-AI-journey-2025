# ✅ Day 12 – Ensemble ML & Evaluation Mastery

---

## 📘 Concepts to Learn (Theory First)
- [ ] What is a Random Forest?
  - [ ] How is it different from a Decision Tree?
  - [ ] What are ensemble models?
  - [ ] Why is it more stable?
- [ ] Understand:
  - [ ] Bias vs Variance (and their tradeoff)
  - [ ] Overfitting vs underfitting (visually)
  - [ ] When should you use Random Forests?

---

## ⚙️ Hands-On Practice
- [ ] Load Titanic (or reuse cleaned dataset)
- [ ] Train a `RandomForestClassifier`
  - [ ] Set `n_estimators=100`, `max_depth=None`
  - [ ] Add `random_state=42`
- [ ] Evaluate model:
  - [ ] Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
  - [ ] Cross-validate using `cross_val_score()`

---

## 📊 Compare with Previous Models
- [ ] Compare RF vs DT vs LR in markdown table
- [ ] Try `.feature_importances_` and plot them
