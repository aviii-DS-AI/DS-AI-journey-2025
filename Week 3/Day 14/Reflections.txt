- What felt unique about KNN vs SVM or RF?
  KNN is:
  Lazy — it doesn’t learn during training; it just stores data.
  Simple & intuitive — it works like: “ask the neighbors and vote.”
  SVM (Support Vector Machine):
  Tries to find the best boundary (hyperplane) between classes.
  It actually learns something complex during training.
  RF (Random Forest):
  A collection of decision trees that vote on the final prediction
  It learns patterns, splits data using logic rules
  KNN is kinda...It's one of the few algorithms that you could "explain on a napkin"

- Which part of it do I now remember confidently?
  The importance of distance and scaling in KNN.
  How KNN makes predictions by looking at nearby points only.

- Could I explain KNN to my younger sibling?
  Okay, So listen You overgrown kid, KNN is sort of lazy algorithm( Not more than you ). It looks for its closest K no of Neighbour data points to make prediction.
  It doesnt train until said to predict. 
  Imagine You go to school, You want the best pen as you can't find a good one. You'll look for your near benches for reccomendations and ask them. Next day you     come up with that particular brand of pen.
