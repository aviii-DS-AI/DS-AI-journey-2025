# ✅ Day 7: Data Visualization – Let the Data Speak 🎨

---

## 📘 Concepts to Learn
- [ ] Why we visualize data — when tables aren’t enough
- [ ] Intro to `matplotlib.pyplot`:
  - [ ] `plot()`, `scatter()`, `bar()`, `hist()`, `title()`, `xlabel()`, `ylabel()`
- [ ] Intro to `seaborn`:
  - [ ] `sns.countplot()`, `sns.boxplot()`, `sns.heatmap()`, `sns.pairplot()`

## 🧠 Practice Tasks
- [ ] Load the Titanic dataset
- [ ] Create:
  - [ ] A bar chart of survival count (Dead vs Survived)
  - [ ] A histogram of passenger ages
  - [ ] A scatter plot of age vs fare
  - [ ] A heatmap of correlations
- [ ] Add titles, labels, legends to your plots

---

## 🔍 Analysis Goals
- [ ] Observe patterns between:
  - [ ] Age & Survival
  - [ ] Fare & Survival
  - [ ] Gender & Survival
- [ ] Write short markdown insights below each plot (What do you notice?)

## 📝 Journal Prompts
- Which plot helped you "see" something new?
- Was anything surprising or unexpected?
- How did it feel interpreting your own visualized data?

---

## 🌱 Optional Stretch Goals
- [ ] Combine multiple plots using `subplots()`
- [ ] Try `sns.FacetGrid()` to break plots by gender/class
- [ ] Save your plots as PNG and add them to your GitHub repo
