# ✅ DAY 5: TO DO List (Data Science & AI/ML Journey)

## 🧠 Concepts to Learn
- **Python Sets & Dictionaries**
  - Operations, use-cases, and methods
  - Real-world use in handling structured data
- **Exception Handling in Python**
  - try / except / else / finally
  - Raising custom exceptions

## 📦 Libraries Exploration
- **NumPy Basics**
  - Arrays vs lists
  - Creating arrays, array operations
  - Slicing, indexing, broadcasting

## 🔁 Practice Tasks
- Create a function using `try/except` to divide numbers with error handling
- Create a dictionary-based student record system (search, insert, update)
- Convert a list into a NumPy array and perform basic math operations
- Compare speed of NumPy array ops vs native Python loops

## 🛠️ Project Mini Task
- Build a mini CLI program to:
  - Store and retrieve info using a dictionary
  - Handle user input safely using exception handling
  - Use NumPy for any number-based calculations

## 🎥 Video Goals (Short & Sweet)

## 📓 Journal/Reflection Prompts (for later)
- What did you find cool about NumPy today?
- How did you handle errors or bugs during code?
- Was there a moment that felt easy or unusually hard?

## ⏳ Bonus (Only if time allows)
- Explore NumPy's `.shape`, `.reshape()`, and `.dtype`
- Try plotting a NumPy array using `matplotlib.pyplot` (just for fun!)
