# âœ… Day 6: DataFrames & Cleaning Data

---

## ðŸ§  Learn & Explore
- [ ] Understand what a **DataFrame** is and why it matters
- [ ] Learn how to:
  - [ ] Load data using `pandas.read_csv()`
  - [ ] Check for missing values with `.isnull()`
  - [ ] Use `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`

---

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning Practice
- [ ] Load a sample dataset (CSV) â€” try `students.csv` or `titanic.csv`
- [ ] Clean the data by:
  - [ ] Removing nulls (`dropna()`) or filling them (`fillna()`)
  - [ ] Changing column names (`rename()`)
  - [ ] Filtering rows with conditions
  - [ ] Sorting values with `.sort_values()`

---

## ðŸ“Š Mini Project
- [ ] Choose a dataset (from Kaggle or anywhere)

  - Any surprising nulls or weird values?
  - What did you clean or change?
