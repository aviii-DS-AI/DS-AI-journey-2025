# ✅ Day 3 – TO DO

## 📘 Python Fundamentals
- [ ] Review Loops: `for` & `while`
  - [ ] Practice nested loops
  - [ ] Use `break`, `continue`, and `pass` with examples
- [ ] Define and use Functions:
  - [ ] Write at least 3 functions (with and without return values)
  - [ ] Use positional, default, and keyword arguments
- [ ] Understand `*args` and `**kwargs`

## 🧠 Logic Practice
- [ ] Solve 3 logic puzzles using loops/functions
  - [ ] Fibonacci series generator
  - [ ] Prime number checker
  - [ ] Count frequency of each word in a sentence (using dict)

## 🧹 Mini Data Wrangling
- [ ] Create a list of dictionaries (e.g. student data)
- [ ] Sort it by a field (e.g. marks or age)
- [ ] Filter entries using a condition (e.g. age > 15)

## 🗒️ Journal & Reflection
- [ ] Write a reflection: Which loop or concept was the hardest? Why?
- [ ] Add a new favorite function or trick you learned today

## 🚀 Optional Stretch Goals
- [ ] Create a mini calculator using functions
- [ ] Rewrite a Day 2 code using a function
- [ ] Visualize a pattern with nested loops (like pyramid/star)
